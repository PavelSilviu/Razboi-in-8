# Razboi in 8 - C++ Board Game Project with GUI

## Overview
Razboi in 8 is an engaging board game project developed in C++ with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game is played on a chessboard and involves two players. Players control their own set of pieces that move diagonally and capture opponents' pieces through diagonal attacks. The player with the highest score emerges as the winner.

## Project Details
Outlined below are key aspects of the project that have been implemented:

### File Organization
To ensure maintainability and ease of navigation, I've organized the project files in a structured manner. Resources, including images and any necessary media, are stored in designated folders.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The project features a GUI that allows players to interact with the game seamlessly. Players can make moves, track scores, and observe the game's progress through intuitive visual elements.

### Game Logic and Mechanics
The core of the project is the game's logic and mechanics. This includes:
- Defining piece movements and interactions on the chessboard.
- Implementing the scoring system to determine the winner.
- Managing user input and interactions through the GUI.

### Data Management
For user authentication and data storage, the project incorporates file-based data management. This includes storing player profiles, scores, and game progress in files.

## Challenges Faced
While developing the project in C++, I encountered challenges such as:
- Integrating the graphical user interface and ensuring smooth user interactions.
- Designing and implementing the game logic to facilitate user moves and piece interactions.

## Future Enhancements
There are several avenues for future development:
- Enhancing the GUI with more interactive features and animations.
- Implementing AI opponents for single-player mode.
- Incorporating multiplayer capabilities through network integration.
